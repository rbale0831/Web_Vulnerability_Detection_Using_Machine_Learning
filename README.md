# WEB VULNERABILITY DETECTION: THE CASE OF CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY

> **Abstract** : Recent years have seen a rise in popularity for the web and web-based technology. It is simple
to extract the web apps' security-sensitive data and features. As the most prevalent source of
sensitive data, online apps are more susceptible to several web-based assaults. One of the main
causes of vulnerabilities is inadequate input validation. Although these flaws are
straightforward and typically cheap to fix, developers are generally uninformed of the security
consequences of these problems. As a result, there are more open web apps online. The security
of user data may be seriously compromised if these flaws are still present in the web
application. Implementing web service security is crucial since they are vulnerable to SQL
injection, and Cross Site Scripting assaults. There is no one solution that can stop all assaults
on online services, despite the numerous strategies that have been suggested for reducing
attacks. In this paper, we provide a way for utilizing Machine Learning to find Vulnerabilities
in online applications. Due to their diversity and the frequent use of bespoke programming
techniques, web applications pose a particularly difficult set of analytical problems. ML is
therefore particularly beneficial for web application security since it can use manually labelled
data to incorporate automatic analysis tools with a human's understanding of the semantics of
online applications. Our goal is to create current machine learning approaches for testing the
performance of Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), which are systems used to identify and
prevent assaults.
